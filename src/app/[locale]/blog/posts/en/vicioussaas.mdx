# The Vicious Cycle of SaaS
## Choosing Software: An *Innocent* Mistake

As I have continued on my journey of consulting and assisting businesses of various sizes around the Metro-Atlanta area, one of the most common pain-points that I run into that seems to permeate every industry is a reliance on overpriced, and under-functioning software that is accompanied by a pricy monthly subscription license. 

Don't get me wrong, I am not against supporting software companies that offer a compelling product at the according value, however, this is an unfortunately tough pill for most business owners to swallow: the SaaS (Sofware as a Service) products that you are paying for right this very moment are needless I.T. sepnd that could be better applied in more critical areas of your business. 

While I begrudgingly admit that there is little chance of escaping the Microsoft Office 365 ecosystem if your business has more than 15 employees, or if there is a large amount of existing business infrastructure already existing in the environment, this is one of the only SaaS providers that I believe any Small or Medium-sized business needs to be engaged in business with.

The amount of conflicting features amongst the various behemoths of the CRM, ERP, and other bloated software industries is something that is a common infestation amongst businesses of all sizes today, as there is rarely enough time for employees to become *fully* and *thoroughly* aquainted the suite of features included in the software ecosystem, and without the help of a trained and seasoned I.T. professional (such as yours truly!) the integration of new software products, or the proper integration of exsiting software products to the overarching business software-stack, is certainly leading to lost profits in lost employee time, improperly functioning software that people need to find workarounds to use properly, and the lack of a personalized touch from the support of the large Software Companies can be overcome with a hybridized Managed I.T. solution, such as the ones that we offer here at Techie Neighbor, LLC. 

Aside from a uniquely-situated philisophical approach to a holisitic I.T. environment that functions at a higher level because it has been deisgend from the ground-up over my years of trial-and-error while working in my entirley Linux-based HomeLab Environment that has taken many forms since it's instatiation in 2017 when it was comprised of two Raspberry Pi's!

My tribulations, undergone through the process of hosting applications locally (not using the cloud, storing data on physical servers - albeit small Single-Board-Computers), furthering this trend, I was able to develop large-scale Mesh-VPN networks using the industry's latest (higly secured and heavily tested) protocols and technologies to deploy WireGuard VPN networks that effortlessly allow users to interact with their devices on a private-cloud and keep all their data (or their companies data) to live in their own cloud, and not pass along all of their vital company data to one of the large tech conglomorates that comprises our modern-day Tech-Oligarchy.

These skills have already been put to the test for local businesses, and have been proven to produce results, and the licensing costs that I am able to break down into non-Techie-speak for *any* business owner, are very valuable tools to have available to you, so you can levereage the power of having your own personal I.T. consultant, as well as the extra backup for your support helpdesk if you already have existing I.T. staff in place.

The combination of preserving your organizations' data integrity, and the cost savings of downsizing unnesscary I.T. spend in the form of costly SaaS licensing, is a winning combination for any business, and I hope to hear from you soon to discuss how I can put these skills to work for your team today! 

Aside from these offerings, I am also now working on customizing local AI Assistants and Chat-Bots that can answer the phone for you and provide a first line of defense for your support, dispatch, sales, or other phone-centric team. 

Thanks for sticking through this lengthier post, and I hope to have a more regular release-schedule going forward!
