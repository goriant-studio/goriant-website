## Overview

In this series of projects, I aim to highlight the varied nature of installations which I have handled, and the professionalism with which I will install and route all cabling for a security camera installation, or a full server rack.

## Key Features

- **FOSS Software**: Built a set of applications, and secure methods of access for a number of small organizations as well as my own self-hosted services, and utilized this knowledge to help business-owners and home-users cut ties with licensing behemnoths.
- **Theming and Customization**: Having the ability to use HomeAssistant as well as other applications runniung on SingleBoardComputers like a RaspberryPi, I have been able to create low-cost solutions to meet business and home users needs, such as a print server.
- **Documentation and Usage Guidelines**: Developed comprehensive documentation to catalogue settings and notes for each installation such that the client will always have exhaustive instrucitons and resources available to them. 
## Challenges and Learnings

One key challenge is always to balance the customer's expectations of cost, time, and ease of integration of various brands of "smart" home equipment, when in reality the installation, security, and resiliancy of these services requires a talented technician to ensure success.
